# collage painter

- inspired by https://timrodenbroeker.de/lowtech-painting-machine/


## notes

NOTES: initial commit (7752842) has custom brush size but does rubber stamp

In most recent version, the cursor doesn't display "correctly" - it's showing the absolute underlying image.

WHICH IS WHAT I WANT FOR ABSOLUTE!

Otherwise, should be displaying the actual thing it will be painting

## TODO

 - paint grid of cursor
